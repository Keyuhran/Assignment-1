The idea and design process:
I decided to choose SG Carmart as the site that I would choose to revamp. The reason why is that although a car selling page has to be informative, the website feels very half done and very dated, with exposed links and a very bare bones design that is not very visually pleasing to the user. Furthermore, the website is littered with unnecessary elements that clutter the page while some menus and pages do not make use of the space at the side, resulting in a very confusing and empty viewing experience.

Therefore I have chosen to revamp the site to provide a more pleasant viewing experience for prospective car buyers, choosing to incorporate the brands colour scheme along with elements that help to more cleanly deliver information about the product that will provide the information to the user in a more palatable manner, not overwhelming and allowing them to have a more clear overview of the product. This has been achieved by making more use of the sides of the pages, as well as enlarging elements such as banners and images to greet the user with a more interactive experience and helping to showcase the product while keeping key information more concisely laid out at other areas of the pages.


Existing Features:
Optimized Layout:

1.Allows users to easily navigate through the website, enhancing the overall user experience.
Visually Pleasing Design:

2.Incorporates the brand's color scheme and enlarges key elements for a more engaging visual experience.

3.Showcases car images and banners in an interactive manner, attracting and retaining user attention.

Features Left to Implement:
Interactive Virtual Test Drives:

1.Integrate a virtual test drive experience where users can virtually explore the interior and exterior of selected car models. This feature provides a unique and immersive way for users to interact with the cars.
Live Chat Support:

2.Add a live chat support feature for real-time assistance. Users can get immediate help with inquiries, enhancing customer support and building trust.
User Reviews and Ratings:

3.Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for specific car models. This user-generated content adds credibility and helps prospective buyers make decisions based on real user experiences.
